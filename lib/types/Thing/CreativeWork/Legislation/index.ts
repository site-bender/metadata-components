For legally-binding links of transposition, use the <a href="/legislationTransposes">legislationTransposes</a> property. For example an informative consolidated law of a European Union's member state "applies" the consolidated version of the European Directive implemented in it. */
	legislationApplies?: Legislation
	/** Another legislation that this legislation changes. This encompasses the notions of amendment, replacement, correction, repeal, or other types of change. This may be a direct change (textual or non-textual amendment) or a consequential or indirect change. The property is to be used to express the existence of a change relationship between two acts rather than the existence of a consolidated version of the text that shows the result of the change. For consolidation relationships, use the <a href="/legislationConsolidates">legislationConsolidates</a> property. */

	/** The person or organization that countersigned the legislation. Depending on the legal context, a countersignature can indicate that the signed authority undertakes to assume responsibility for texts emanating from a person who is inviolable and irresponsible, (for example a King, Grand Duc or President), or that the authority is in charge of the implementation of the text. */

	legislationDateOfApplicability?: Date
	/** The point-in-time at which the provided description of the legislation is valid (e.g.: when looking at the law on the 2016-04-07 (= dateVersion), I get the consolidation of 2015-04-12 of the "National Insurance Contributions Act 2015") */
	legislationDateVersion?: Date
	/** Indicates that this Legislation ensures the implementation of another Legislation, for example by modifying national legislations so that they do not contradict to an EU regulation or decision.

	/** Another legislation that this legislation repeals (cancels, abrogates). */
	legislationRepeals?: Legislation
	/** An individual or organization that has some kind of responsibility for the legislation. Typically the ministry who is/was in charge of elaborating the legislation, or the adressee for potential questions about the legislation once it is published. */
	legislationResponsible?: Organization | Person
	/** Indicates that this legislation (or part of legislation) fulfills the objectives set by another legislation, by passing appropriate implementation measures. Typically, some legislations of European Union's member states or regions transpose European Directives. This indicates a legally binding link between the 2 legislations. */
