## ÔøΩ PHASE 1: DATABASE & AUTHENTICATION FOUNDATION

### 1.1 Supabase Integration with Deno Deploy Edge Functions

- [ ] **Set up Deno Deploy edge functions with Supabase SDK**
  - [ ] Install and configure `@supabase/supabase-js` for Deno
  - [ ] Create edge function architecture that communicates with Supabase
  - [ ] Ensure all API keys remain secure on server-side only
  - [ ] Create connection to both databases:
    - `a-storied-life` (production database)
    - `test-a-storied-life` (test database with extensive test data)

- [ ] **Database query infrastructure**
  - [ ] Create database connection utilities for edge functions
  - [ ] Implement query helpers for common operations
  - [ ] Set up connection pooling and error handling
  - [ ] Create separate configs for production vs test databases

- [ ] **Database migrations system**
  - [ ] Set up migration runner that works with both databases
  - [ ] Create migration structure in `database/data/` folder
  - [ ] Ensure migrations can run on both `a-storied-life` and `test-a-storied-life`
  - [ ] Add safeguards to prevent test data in production database

### 1.2 Test Data Infrastructure

- [ ] **Create extensive test data migrations**
  - [ ] Design realistic test data that mimics production data shapes
  - [ ] Create table-by-table migrations in `database/data/`
  - [ ] Ensure test data covers edge cases and various scenarios
  - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Test data migrations only run on `test-a-storied-life`, never production

- [ ] **Test data requirements**:
  - [ ] Users with various roles and states (active, inactive, different permissions)
  - [ ] Content in various stages (draft, published, archived)
  - [ ] Complex relationships between users and content
  - [ ] Edge case data (very long content, special characters, etc.)
  - [ ] Large volume data for performance testing

### 1.3 Authentication & Authorization Implementation

- [ ] **Supabase Magic Links Authentication**
  - [ ] Set up Supabase Auth with magic links
  - [ ] Create sign in/sign up form (single form for both)
  - [ ] Implement backend logic:
    - Check if user exists ‚Üí magic link for sign in
    - User doesn't exist ‚Üí add to `registrants` table ‚Üí confirmation email
  - [ ] Set up email templates and confirmation flow

- [ ] **Single Sign In/Up Form Requirements**:
  - [ ] One email field + "Sign In or Up" button
  - [ ] Backend determines sign in vs registration based on existing email
  - [ ] Clear user feedback about what action was taken
  - [ ] Email confirmation for new registrations
  - [ ] Magic link authentication for existing users

- [ ] **Progressive Enhancement: Biometric Authentication**
  - [ ] Research and implement biometric authentication as enhancement
  - [ ] WebAuthn/FIDO2 implementation
  - [ ] Fallback gracefully to email-only auth when biometrics unavailable

- [ ] **Row Level Security (RLS)**
  - [ ] Implement Supabase RLS policies
  - [ ] Ensure authenticated users can only access authorized data
  - [ ] Test RLS policies thoroughly with various user scenarios

  - [ ] Add aria-live regions for formatting feedback
  - [ ] Complete missing formatter implementations (14 remaining formatters)
  - [ ] Add comprehensive country code support for postal codes

- [ ] **Server-Side Form Enhancement** (Future - Deno Deploy Phase)
  - [ ] Pre-generate validation patterns server-side
  - [ ] Implement server-side validation using same formatter functions
  - [ ] Add server-side pattern validation as fallback for JS-disabled users
  - [ ] Create shared validation/pattern system between client and server

- [ ] **Form Field Standardization**
  - [ ] Complete refactoring of remaining simple fields to use LabelWrapper
  - [ ] Review complex fields (PhoneNumberField, etc.) for accessibility improvements
  - [ ] Add select element support to LabelWrapper for ChooseOneField ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Ensure all fields follow WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility standards
  - [ ] Rename FormattedField ‚Üí FormattedTextField for consistency
  - [ ] Rename AutocompleteField ‚Üí TypeaheadTextField for consistency

### 2.4 Data-Type-Driven Form Architecture (Future - Advanced Phase)

## üéØ CURRENT PRIORITY FOCUS

**NEXT STEPS (Immediate priorities)**:

1. **Supabase Integration** - Set up edge functions with Supabase SDK
2. **Database Connections** - Implement query infrastructure for both databases
3. **Test Data System** - Create migration system for extensive test data
4. **Authentication Foundation** - Implement magic link auth with single form

---

## üìÅ KEY FILES & LOCATIONS

**Database & Types**:
- `database/data/` - Test data migrations (to be created)
- `src/types/` - TypeScript types (needs cleanup)

**Authentication**:
- `src/routes/sign-in-or-up/` - Single auth form (to be enhanced)

**Testing**:
- `tests/tasks/` - Behavioral tests (currently use `/backstage` entry point)

**Current Placeholder**:
- `src/routes/index.tsx` - Shows "Nothing to see here" (needs replacement)

---

## üîç VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Current behavioral test (uses /backstage)
deno run --allow-all tests/tasks/information-access/access-about-information/index.test.ts

# Check placeholder home page
curl http://localhost:5555/ | grep -i "nothing to see"

# Verify backstage functionality
curl http://localhost:5555/backstage | grep -i "shootout"

# Run all tests
deno task test

# Check TypeScript compliance
deno task check
```

---

## üìù NOTES & CONTEXT

- **Architecture**: Deno Deploy edge functions ‚Üî Supabase (API keys secure on backend)
- **Testing**: `/backstage` currently used as entry point, will switch to `/` when real home page ready
- **Database Strategy**: Dual database setup for production and testing with extensive test data
- **Authentication Flow**: Single form determines sign in vs sign up, progressive enhancement with biometrics
- **Type Safety**: Database-first approach with generated TypeScript types
