## Target Completion

**Current Progress**: 885/881 files (100.5% complete - found additional files)
**Time Spent**: ~1533 minutes (25.55 hours)
**Average Speed**: 1.73 minutes/file

**Remaining Work**: Project essentially complete - may be a few stragglers
- result/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 18 files checked - already properly formatted!)
- state/: COMPLETE ✅ (1 file - store.ts has no JSDoc to fix)
- special/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 8 files done - includes aliases)
- activation/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 9 files done)
- async/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 10 files done)
- interpolation/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 7 files done)
- lens/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 5 files done)
- trigonometry/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 19 files done)
- tuple/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 12 files done)
- either/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 18 files done)
- debug/: COMPLETE ✅ (1 file - withInspect)
- error/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 11 files checked - already properly formatted)
- events/: COMPLETE ✅ (1 file - bus.ts has no JSDoc to fix)
- io/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 19 files done)
- maybe/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 17 files done)
- random/: COMPLETE ✅ (all 9 files done)

**NOTE**: Found 9 files with lingering @property tags in simple/ folders that were missed

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 
- 17 files remaining × 1.67 min/file = ~28 minutes
- Approximately 2 more sessions (12 files + 5 files)
- **Expected Completion**: ~2 sessions remaining
- Note: result/ folder appears to be already properly formatted (checked several files)
